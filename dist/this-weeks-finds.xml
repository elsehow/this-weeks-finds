    Ivan Martinovic et al. USENIX '12. Dawn Song was on this paper.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
    We use inexpensive electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI devices to test
    the feasibility of simple, yet effective, attacks. The captured
    EEG signal could reveal the user’s private information
    about, e.g., bank cards, PIN numbers, area of living,
    the knowledge of the known persons [..]
    We show that the entropy of the private
    information is decreased on the average by approximately
    15 % - 40 % compared to random guessing attacks.

    A quote from Uber CSO Joe Sullivan:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
    Gyrometers in phones can measure small movements, while GPS and accelerometers show how often a vehicle starts and stops, as well as its overall speed. If a rider complains that a driver accelerated too fast and broke too hard, we can review that trip using data. If the feedback is accurate, then we can get in touch with the driver. And if it’s not, we could use the information to make sure a driver’s rating isn’t affected.

    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>
    "Heartbeats can now be measured without placing sensors on the human body, thanks to a new technology developed in Japan. 'Taking measurements with sensors on the body can be stressful and troublesome, because you have to stop what you're doing,' says Hiroyuki Sakai, a researcher at Panasonic. 'What we tried to make was something that would offer people a way to monitor their body in a casual and relaxed environment.'"
